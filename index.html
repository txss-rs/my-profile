      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        I have three great passions: travel, literature, and kung fu. I've been fortunate to travel extensively since I was young (mainly in Europe), which has shaped who I am today. Trips to Sri Lanka and Lapland have particularly impacted me. Literature, especially philosophy, helps me expand my knowledge and reflect on various topics while serving as an escape. Kung fu, a traditional Chinese martial art, combines strength, agility, and mental discipline. After practicing for six years, I gained valuable insights into balance, self-discipline, and personal growth.
